# Description

Welcome to Fit-App! This application was created as a personal project to test and enhance my web development skills. As someone who used a note-taking app on my phone to track gym sessions, I realized the need for a more dedicated and efficient solution. Thus, Fit-App was born.

Fit-App is a lightweight and user-friendly application designed to help you track your gym sessions with ease. Here are some of the features:

- **Create Programs:** Design and customize your workout programs.

- **Modify Programs:** Update your existing programs to fit your evolving fitness goals.

- **Delete Programs:** Remove programs that are no longer needed.

- **Start Workouts:** Begin your workouts and log your exercises.

- **Save Workouts:** Save your workout sessions for future reference.

- **View Workout History:** Review all your completed workouts in a comprehensive history.

Fit-App aims to streamline the process of tracking your workouts, making it easier for you to stay on top of your fitness journey. I hope you find this app helpful and enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Thank you for using Fit-App!
